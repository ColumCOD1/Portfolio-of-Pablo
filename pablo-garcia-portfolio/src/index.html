                    <br>
                    <p>To the recruiter and hiring manager to whom it may concern, thank you for taking the time to review my web page dedicated to showcasing my experience and capabilities.
                    <br>
                    <p>My  name  is  Pablo Alexander Garcia,  I'm  a Web Developer,  Hospitality Manager that specializes in Bar Development, Marketing Strategist  and
                    leader  that  isn't  afraid  of  evolving  and  adapting  within challenging  environments.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After dedicating more 3 years in FullStack development and 5 years in overall web development and marketing. 
                     I like to believe I have firm understanding of the field I've dedicated half a decade to through accumulated work experience as a freelancer in web development and promotion design. </p>
                    
                    <p>In  my  24  years  of  life,  11  of  them  have  been  spent  in  the  overall  workforce  learning  the  value  of  hard  work  and  the  lessons  they  provide.  That  being  said,  I  firmly  believe  that  life  itself  provides  the  necessary  hardships  in  order  to mold  you  into  the  best  possible  version  of  yourself  if  you're  willing  to  learn  from your  failures  and  successes.</p>
